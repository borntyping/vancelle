============

Vancelle is an incredibly personal application. I'd be incredibly hyped if
someone else finds it useful (which is partly why it's open source), but I've no
plans to accept changes in the same way I would for my other open source
projects. If it unexpectedly becomes popular, I'd probably split it into a
public project and my own personal fork.

submitting pull requests, or just interested in talking about how you're using
it. Please don't do lots of work and make a pull request you expect me to merge
without having a chat first.
